The example to the right from Cad√≠z, Spain shows how large horizontal changes from tidal shifts can be. Using tide level data, corrections can be made to where the shoreline position would be given mean sea level removing noise added by tidal fluctuations. <p>The refernece elevation is selected by the user and relative to Local Mean Sea Level. In most cases 0 m is a good start. This will be the elevation all shorelines are corrected back to. For example, if the tide height is 0.3 m above LMSL, assuming a linear beach slope, the shoreline will be pushed seaward back to LMSL</p>\n",

While the wealth of data (PlanetScope has near-daily revisit time) enables us to deduce clear shoreline change signals despite much of this noise, it is still important to remove outliers. Below median filtering is used to remove outliers that are not within the `limit` (in meters) of the median (`median - limit < x < median + limit`). This filtered transect intersection dataframe is saved `outputs/<region/<sitename>_QAQC_transect_interesections.csv`."
